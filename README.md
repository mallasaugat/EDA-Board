# EDA-Board

The EDA-Board is a powerful tool designed to streamline and expedite the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, reducing the time required for data exploration tasks. It offers a basic online platform with key functionalities aimed at providing users with insights into their datasets.

## Key Features:

### 1. Dataset Characteristics Identification:
- Extracts the number of features and columns within the dataset.
- Identifies and visualizes columns containing missing values through a bar graph displaying the percentage of missing values.

### 2. Datatype Analysis:
- Categorizes data into continuous and categorical values.
- Provides visual representation of data distribution using a pie chart.

### 3. Dataset Description:
- Offers a detailed description of the dataset to provide users with a better understanding of its structure and contents.

### 4. Graphical Representations:
- Visualizes the dataset through various graphical representations, including:
  - Bar graphs illustrating missing values distribution.
  - Pie chart depicting the proportion of categorical and continuous values.
  - Histograms for clear visualization of data distributions.
  - Count plot highlighting the distribution of the target variable.
  - Heatmap/Correlation matrix to analyze inter-feature relationships.
